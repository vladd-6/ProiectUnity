# Leap of Death

## Description

**Leap of Death** is an intense, fast-paced single-player movement shooter that fuses high-octane gunplay with fluid parkour mechanics. Navigate treacherous, vertically-oriented arenas, chain together wall runs, leaps, and slides to outmaneuver your enemies, and eliminate all targets in a ballet of bullets and momentum.

**Core Vision:** To create a seamless experience where your skill in movement is just as important as your aim, encouraging a dynamic and aggressive playstyle.
